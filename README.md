An amateur attempt at creating a D&D 5e character creator. 
The plan is to have 2 versions. The simple and then the complex UI builders.
The end goal for each builder is to produce a character sheet at the end for easy download and use.
Data for D&D 5e content will be sourced using Foundry VTT compatible files for ease of use and importing


Currently working on the simple UI version.
Class, proficiencies, background and character sheet need to be added.
